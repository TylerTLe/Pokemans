JavaScript Pocket Monster

Welcome to my JavaScript Pokemon derivative. This repository contains the source code of a delightful, engaging and exciting browser-based game that's inspired by the classic Pok√©mon franchise, built entirely using JavaScript and modern web technologies.

The game simulates a pocket monster world, where players embark on a thrilling adventure exploring diverse environments, catching exotic creatures, and battling against formidable foes, all within the confines of their browser. As trainers, players can evolve their creatures, explore new lands, and strive to become the ultimate monster master!
